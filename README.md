# LimitlessLED Chrome App

A Chrome app that acts as a proxy between chrome extensions and a LimitlessLED-compatible wifi bridge. There are various brands that use the LimitlessLED protocol, the most popular of which is Milight.

Because Chrome extensions can not access the Chrome network stack, a Chrome application is a necessity. Chrome extensions can then send messages to the Chrome application to have it trigger commands on your lights.
